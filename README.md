# Python For Finance
Examples inspired by the book Python for Finance

Book: Python for Finance, 2nd ed, Hilpisch, Yves

## Why does this repo exist?

I started reading Python for Finance after being introduced to it through an online class on Udacity, Machine Learning for Trading.
I was unable to locate the dataset used in the book that demonstrates the code samples, so I began searching for available sources of similar data.
This repository is a result of that search.

## How do I use this repo?

Download the data (*.zip) and source code (*.ipynb)
