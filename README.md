# Python For Finance
A repo of examples inspired by the book *Python for Finance*

Book: *[Python for Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Finance-Mastering-Data-Driven/dp/1492024333/ref=sr_1_3?crid=Q54A45DY5MHP&dchild=1&keywords=python+for+finance+by+yves+hilpisch&qid=1604860574&sprefix=python+for+finance+yves%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-3), 2nd ed, Hilpisch, Yves*


## Why does this repo exist?

I started reading Python for Finance after being introduced to it through an online class on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), Machine Learning for Trading.
I was unable to locate the dataset used in the book that demonstrates the code samples, so I began searching for available sources of similar data.
This repository is a result of that search.

## How do I use this repo?

1. Download the source code (*.ipynb)
2. Download the data from [Stooq](https://stooq.com/db/h/)

*The source code requires the following file folder structure:*
- ./                     Run Jupyter Lab or Python from this level in the folder structure
- ./data/daily/us/       Data files are located under this branch
- ./data/daily/world/    More data files
